## Languages & tools

### HTML

### JavaScript

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) can prevent bad git commit, git push and more üê∂ woof!
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) by doing so you can ensure no errors go into the repository and enforce code style.
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) is used for UI.

### CSS

- [Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is the result of wondering how we could enhance CSS for styling React component systems.

### Client server with Livereload

The app embed for development a static connect server with livereload plugged.
So each time you start the app, you get automatic refresh in the browser whenever you update a file.
